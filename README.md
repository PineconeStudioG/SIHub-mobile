# SIHub
YouTube front-end designed for consuming self-improvement content

If you are tired of doomscrolling through YouTube consuming meaningless content and want to see useful, educational content about science, psychology, fitness, finance and overall wellbeing then SIHub comes for your rescue.

<b>This is a mobile app version of a SIHub project
<br>To see desktop website check [SIHub-web](https://github.com/PineconeStudioG/SIHub-web) repository
<br>Full project consists of repositories: [SIHub-web](https://github.com/PineconeStudioG/SIHub-web) and [SIHub-mobile](https://github.com/PineconeStudioG/SIHub-mobile)</b>

# How it works
SIHub is not an independent platform - it takes selected YouTube channels and their videos using YouTube API and video embed feature. Then it displays them in non-distracting way so that you can focus on the video itself rather than scroll through comments or list of proposed videos.
